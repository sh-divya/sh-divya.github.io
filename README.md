# About Me

Hi, I am a 3rd Year PhD Student at Johns Hopkins University, working under [Prof. Paulette Clancy](https://clancygroup.wse.jhu.edu/). I am currently working on a Crystal Strcture Prediction task using deep learning and graph representation learning; and a first principles investigation into the properties of a corrosion and fatigue resistant novel film on maritime metal alloys
