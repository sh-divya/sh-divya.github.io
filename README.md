# About Me

Hi, I am a Postdoctoral Researcher, working with [Prof. Yoshua Bengio](https://yoshuabengio.org/) and [Prof. Alex Hernandez-Gracia](https://alexhernandezgarcia.github.io/) at [MILA](https://mila.quebec/en) and [UdeM](https://www.umontreal.ca/en/). My current work focuses on developing and applying machine learning models that can be used to acclerate discovery and experimentation on materials aimed at tackling the challenges that humanity faces today. Broadly, I am interested in combining domain expertise / physics into machine learning techniques as a tool to supplement scientific discovery.

## Current Projects

* Developing property prediction proxies for materials using multimodal data
* Training computer-vision model using multimodal data in low-data regime to inform active learning decisions for carbon-capture catalysts
