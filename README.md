# About Me

Hi, I am a Final Year PhD Student at Johns Hopkins University, working under [Prof. Paulette Clancy](https://clancygroup.wse.jhu.edu/). I am currently working on a Crystal Strcture Prediction task using deep learning using GANs on a 4D tensor representation of crystals. Additionally, I am also collaborating with researchers at [MILA](https://mila.quebec/en/) to apply state of the art generative modelling techinques for materials discovery. On the simulation side of things, I am investigating the interfacial free energy of a solid-solid interface using Molecular Dynamics.
