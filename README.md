# About Me

Hi, I am a 2nd Year PhD Student at Johns Hopkins University, working under [Prof. Paulette Clancy](https://clancygroup.wse.jhu.edu/). I am currently working on exploring combinatorial space of novel [biomolecules'](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acschembio.6b00837) backbone to extract promising candidates for antibiotics. I am also working on evaluating the performance of the Climbing-Image Nudged Elastic Method as a tool for determining the transistion state in a chemical transition. My research interests involve supplementing insights and data from simulations on materials with machine learning techniques to aide materials discovery.
